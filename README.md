TASK : 2.SENTIMENT-ANALYSIS-WITH-NLP
This project presents a comprehensive approach to sentiment analysis by applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to a dataset containing customer reviews. The primary objective is to automatically determine the sentiment conveyed in each review—whether positive, negative, or neutral—using supervised machine learning. The process begins with data preprocessing, where raw textual data is cleaned by removing special characters, converting to lowercase, and optionally handling stopwords or stemming. The cleaned text is then converted into a numerical format using TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) vectorization, which effectively captures the importance of words in context. A Logistic Regression model is employed as the classification algorithm due to its simplicity, efficiency, and effectiveness for binary and multiclass text classification tasks. After training the model, its performance is rigorously evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, derived from the classification report. This project not only showcases the end-to-end pipeline for sentiment analysis but also emphasizes the practical applications of machine learning in understanding user opinions, enhancing customer experience, and supporting data-driven decision-making in business and marketing environments.
